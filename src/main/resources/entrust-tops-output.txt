A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, 
physicalmatter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this 
behaviorusing specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum 
devices,and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than 
anymodern "classical" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break 
widelyused encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the 
currentstate of the art is largely experimental and impractical. The basic unit of information in 
quantumcomputing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a 
classicalbit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two "basis" states, which loosely means that it 
isin both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of 
aclassical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave 
interferenceeffects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms 
involvescreating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently. 
Physicallyengineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not 
sufficientlyisolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into 
calculations.National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop 
scalablequbits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising 
technologiesare superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical 
resistance)and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Any 
computationalproblem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer.[2] 
Conversely,any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, 
atleast in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the 
Church–Turingthesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over 
classicalcomputers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have 
significantlylower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum

computersare believed to be able to solve certain problems quickly that no classical computer could 
solvein any feasible amount of time—a feat known as "quantum supremacy." The study of the 
computationalcomplexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity 
theory.For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic 
communities.[3]Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the wave–particle duality observed at 
atomicscales,[4] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers 
fortedious calculations.[5] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; 
computersplayed a major role in wartime cryptography,[6] and quantum physics was essential for the 
nuclearphysics used in the Manhattan Project.[7] As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to 
computationalproblems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer 
sciencebegan to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses 
quantumtheory to describe a simplified computer.[8] When digital computers became faster, 
physicistsfaced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[9] prompting 
YuriManin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena 
mightbe more efficient for computer simulation.[10][11][12] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and 
GillesBrassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key 
distributioncould enhance information security.[13][14] Peter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 
1994that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption. Quantum algorithms 
thenemerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985,[15] the 
Bernstein–Vaziranialgorithm in 1993,[16] and Simon's algorithm in 1994.[17] These algorithms did not solve 
practicalproblems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a 
blackbox with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[18] 
PeterShor built on these results with his 1994 algorithms for breaking the widely used RSA and 
Diffie–Hellmanencryption protocols,[19] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum 
computing.[20]In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable

unstructuredsearch problem.[21][22] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could 
simulatequantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[23] 
validatingFeynman's 1982 conjecture.[24] Over the years, experimentalists have constructed 
small-scalequantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[25] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum 
computerdemonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[26][27] and subsequent experiments have 
increasedthe number of qubits and reduced error rates.[25] In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that 
theyhad achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is 
impossiblefor any classical computer.[28][29][30] However, the validity of this claim is still being 
activelyresearched.[31][32]
